                I enjoy looking at how things are functionally and aesthetically
                designed, both in a physical and virtual space, and finding ways
                to improve them.

                Outside of work, I play all the video games, I do urban-style
                dancing, listen to music all the time, and occasionally imagine
                what it would be like to have a Shiba Inu.

                I love traveling ever since I was a kid. Currently my bucketlist
                has cities and places such as: Singapore, Japan, Germany, South
                Korea, Hong Kong & Taiwan.
