## ***RELEASE NOTES***
### FLOW 2019 VERSION 1.0

# What is Flow?
- Flow is an application that intends to be an alternative for chrome where a user can keep track of their history without having to look for it.  

### What works:

- **Tab Management**
  - The chrome extension keeps track of your history as soon as you close your tab. 
  - The history that was captured can be seen in the category section at your homepage. 
- **Background brought to you by unsplash**
  - Enjoy a fresh set of background everytime you refresh the app. 
- **Time and Weather**
  - Alongside with a very soothing background, the app provides a weather and time determined by your location.

### Future Implementation:
- Allow the users have their own categories
- Quotes that can motivate / inspire users.
- Implementing an AI to best categorize the user's history.

### BUGS:
- The history disappears when the user goes to another page within the site unless its refreshed.
